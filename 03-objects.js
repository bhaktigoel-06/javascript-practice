/**
 * DRILL 03 — OBJECTS, SAFELY
 *
 * Two ideas in this drill.
 *
 * 1. IMMUTABLE UPDATES — instead of changing an array or object, you make a new
 *    one with the change already in it. It feels like extra work at first. It
 *    prevents a whole category of bugs where something changes underneath you
 *    and you can't work out who did it.
 *
 * 2. READING DATA SAFELY — real data has holes in it. `?.` and `??` let you deal
 *    with a missing field without your program falling over.
 *
 * Run:  npm test -- --test-name-pattern="objects"

/**
 * Adds a student to the end of the list, WITHOUT changing the original array.

 *   addStudent(students, c)   →  [a, b, c]
 *   students                  →  [a, b]     (still the same!)
 *
 * `push` would change the original. Spread the old array into a new one instead.

/**
 * Formats a GPA for display, to one decimal place.
 *
 *   formatGpa(8.4)        →  '8.4'
 *   formatGpa(9)          →  '9.0'
 *   formatGpa(0)          →  '0.0'    ← look carefully at this one
 *   formatGpa(null)       →  '—'
 *   formatGpa(undefined)  →  '—'
 *
 * Here's the interesting bit. It's tempting to write `gpa || '—'`. But `0` is
 * one of JavaScript's "falsy" values, so a student who genuinely scored 0 would
 * get an em-dash and their real mark would vanish from the screen.
 *
 * `??` only steps in for `null` and `undefined` — which is what you actually
 * meant. This is a small difference that catches almost everybody once.
 *
 * (`(8.4).toFixed(1)` gives you the one-decimal string.)
